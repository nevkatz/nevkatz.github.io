    <h4 id="getting-jekyll-working-again-with-the-latest-version-of-ruby">Getting Jekyll working again with the latest version of Ruby</h4>

<p>This site is published with Jekyll, a static site generator that publishes raw HTML files using markdown files and templates.  I wanted a solution that allowed me to write and publish without getting bogged down in security updates and other types of back-end maintenance, but also allowed me to innovate on the front-end when I wanted. I was drawn to Jekyll because of how it enabled me to build a site efficiently.</p>

<p>Before firing up this site, I had briefly experimented with Jekyll in 2017 after hearing about it on Tom Johnson’s <a href="http://www.idratherbewriting.com">I’d Rather Be Writing</a> site. and then I started it up again this month in 2019 after hearing about Becca Williams, another developer, having success with it.</p>

<h4 id="jekyll-setup">Jekyll Setup</h4>

<p>As with other tools I have run from the command line, the setup process had the usual trickiness with versions and tool chains — but after getting things up and running, I have to say that love the easy deployment process. Below I’ll detail what it was like.</p>

<p>The first challenge was making sure I had the latest version of Jekyll running, as I had installed Jekyll 3.6.2 two years ago to just try it out. When trying to install 3.8.6 with my Mac’s installed version of Ruby, I ran into permissions issues. So I had to download a version of Ruby that was independent of my Mac version. This proved to be the breakthrough I needed, and I was able to download and run Jekyll 3.8.6.</p>

<h4 id="running-the-local-server">Running the local server</h4>

<p>One thing that I found myself adjusting to was the static site generator. It is easy enough to use and <code>jekyll serve</code> starts a server process on your machine, running a local dev site in your browser. A <code>_sites</code> directory is generated containing your output files. One thing to note, though, is that he <code>_sites</code> directory does not load in the CSS if you open it without having jekyll serve running. You need that server process for it to look right.</p>

<h4 id="adding-css">Adding CSS</h4>

<p>One thing that initially perplexed me was where to put the styles. Jekyll uses sass and when you run jekyll serve the sass automaticallly compiles - but it was not obvious how to add other styles initially.</p>

<p>I had seen a _sass directory initially in Jekyll 3.x(?) but when I updated to Jekyll 3.8.6,  that the _sass directory was no longer there, nor were other key directories. I read that these were now included in the gem theme, so I used <code>bundle show minima</code> to find its location. I then copied _sass, _layouts, _includes, and assets over from the theme and overrode parts of the templates and styles that I wanted to change.</p>

<p>After exploring the directory, I decided on two approaches for styles:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a custom.scss file that is imported so the css shows up in main.css</li>
  <li>a separate custom.css file</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="adding-code-views">Adding Code views</h4>

<p>Jekyll has natural styles for marking up code, but I wanted something with a little more pop. Becca Williams (include twitter handle) had recommended the Prism Library, so I went ahead and added it.</p>

<h4 id="tabs">Tabs</h4>

<p>I wrote up a quick script and styles for adding tabs so that viewing HTML would be easy. The script is available here and the styles are on this sheet.</p>

<h4 id="perils-with-pagination">Perils with Pagination</h4>

<p>There is a new pagination-v2 module that I am now using. After looking at a lot of examples, I eventually used the config 2 module.</p>

<h4 id="the-banner">The banner</h4>

<p>As I was really into SVGs and I’ve been on a dragon illustration kick for the past year, I wanted to create an SVG banner with a dragon. The trickiest thing was figuring out CSS to get it to look responsive.</p>

<h4 id="sorting-for-creating-a-course-page">Sorting for creating a course page</h4>

<p>This was fairly easy. I looked at how to assign variables in the jekyll template:</p>

<p><code> assign sorted = .... </code></p>

<h3 id="wiring-git-to-github-pages">Wiring Git to Github Pages</h3>

<p>I was originally storing my github-pages publishable stuff in a completely different repo and actually copying all the stuff from the _sites directory over to that repo every time I wanted to publish and push. Needless to say, I wanted omsething more efficient.</p>

<p>After reading about other approaches, my approach was to simply wire the _sites directory to Github pages, but because my overall jekyll directory was under site version control, I was worried about having a repo within a repo. Fortunately, .gitignore in my jekyll repo had my back, because it automatically ignores the _sites folder. So I moved the .git directory from github-pages into my _sites folder and voila — the _sites folder was under version control and wired to Git, and I now have all my jekyll assets in one place.</p>

<p>One thing I found, though, is that running <code>jekyll clean</code> will blow away the git repo, so it’s not something I want to do on a regular basis, but otherwise, the workflow works well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>installing prism</li>
  <li>transfer this new site to github pages - a repo within a repo</li>
  <li>write content
    <ul>
      <li>smiley face SVG</li>
      <li>vodafone? maybe just for fun…</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>code a new version of the face tracker</li>
  <li>basic viewbox tests</li>
</ul>
