    <h3 id="journey-into-node-js">Journey into Node JS!</h3>

<p>Suppose you want a program that can handle server-side operations, like writing to a database or a file system, but you feel that content management systems like WordPress and Drupal have more features than you need — and may not be worth the maintenance and setup steps.</p>

<p>Or suppose you want to try writing a desktop application that can output files, and speak Javascript as your native tongue.</p>

<p>If you’re in this situation, I recommend exploring Node JS — a lightweight open-source platform for developing server-side applications with Javascript.</p>

<p>As a developer who has either used Drupal content management systems or Android / I/OS apps to interact with databases and file systems, I am finding Node JS to be an exciting foray into using Javascript to run server-side applications using a lightweight solution.</p>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>Using Node JS requires a familiarity with the command line, and if your machine does not already have it, you will need to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/">install</a> it on your machine.</p>

<p>Once you have Node installed, running a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide/">Hello World</a> program is pretty straightforward. But before getting into the syntax, let’s look at what Node JS is and why it is unique.</p>

<h3 id="node-js">Node JS</h3>

<p>Node JS, originally released in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, helps to redefine Javascript’s place in the world by making it efficient at running server-side applications.</p>

<p>While it was not the first Javascript server side platform — that credit goes to Netscape’s LiveWire Pro Web in 1996 - it is set apart by being event-driven - in other words, driven events such as user user clicks - is able to do the things a server must do efficiently. It also is scalable, efficient, and easy to learn.</p>

<p>And with the right modules, such as the Node JS <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html" target="_blank">File System</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/http.html">http</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_mysql.asp">MySQL</a>, can enable server programs to interact with the file system, a database, and the browser client.</p>

<p>Of all of Node’s features, the file system capability is currently what draws me it. While Node is widely used for websites and web applications, I am right now interested in using it to create local desktop applications that can create and modify files and file systems.</p>

<h3 id="intro-to-blocking-and-non-blocking-io">Intro to Blocking and Non-blocking I/O</h3>

<p>One “under the hood” feature that makes Node JS useful is non-blocking I/O, or non-blocking input/output.</p>

<p>What does this mean? I/O, or input/output, refers to a program interacting with the outside world, either by receiving or sending information. An I/O interaction usually occurs in the context of a <strong>thread</strong>, or a singular sequential flow of control in a program. Some steps in a thread may involve an I/O operation, while others may involve operations within the program. During an I/O operation, the program sends out a request, and gets a response.</p>

<h3 id="blocking-versus-non-blocking">Blocking versus Non-Blocking</h3>

<p>If an I/O operation <em>blocks</em>, it means that after a program sends an I/O request, nothing happens in a given thread until a response is received and the operation is complete. If it is non-blocking, it means that the thread can keep going with something else while it waits for a response.</p>

<p>In my case, I am primarily interested in I/O operations occuring between the server program and the browser client, as well as the server program and the file system.</p>

<p>Before we look at the details of Non-Blocking I/O, let’s first take a closer look at threads and the processes they reside in.</p>

<h3 id="threads-and-processes">Threads and Processes</h3>

<p>When a program and its resources are loaded into memory and begins to run, it is called a <strong>process</strong>. Within this process, there are one or more units of execution called <strong>threads</strong>. These can be thought of as mini-processes within a process. In processes with multiple threads, these threads share the same memory.</p>

<h3 id="single-threaded-versus-multi-threaded">Single-Threaded versus Multi-Threaded</h3>

<p>Different programming languages have different ways of handling processes and threads. Some, like Javascript, can run just one unit of execution at a time, and are called <strong>single-threaded.</strong> Others, like Java and C#, can multi-task and have multiple threads running within one process.</p>

<h3 id="blocking-io">Blocking I/O</h3>

<p>While Java can follow multiple instructions at a time, it also uses <strong>blocking I/O</strong>, which means that a thread that is reading or writing a file is blocked until it finishes inputting info from a file or outputting information to a file. In other words, it stops what it is doing until the file input/output process is complete before moving on.</p>

<h3 id="non-blocking-io">Non-blocking I/O</h3>

<p>If blocking I/O were to happen in Node JS file system operation, it would be super slow, because you would be blocking your only thread in the program. So instead, Node JS has <strong>non-blocking I/O</strong>, which allows it to send out a request to the file system and move on to another operation while it waits for a response to that request.</p>

<h3 id="non-blocking-operations-in-node-js-are-asynchronous">Non-blocking operations in Node JS are asynchronous</h3>

<p>As an aside, non-blocking operations in Javascript are asynchronous (or async for short), which means that the request-and-response sequence does not require continual attention by the program or occur as consecutive steps. You can start learning about async request at <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_asynchronous.asp" target="_blank">w3schools</a>, including and we will ahve</p>

<h3 id="hope-this-helps">Hope this helps!</h3>

<p>This has been a quick look at Node JS and non-blocking I/O. More information about blocking and non-blocking I/O can be found at the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/" target="_blank">Node JS</a> website.</p>
